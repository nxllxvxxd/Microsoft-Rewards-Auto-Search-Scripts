##### Setup

##### Editing The Code

To customize the amount of time between searches and what the search terms contain you will want to edit the [Mobile Searches Script](https://github.com/Darth4212/Microsoft-Rewards-Auto-Search-Scripts/blob/master/Mobile%20Searches%20Script) and the [Desktop Searches Script](https://github.com/Darth4212/Microsoft-Rewards-Auto-Search-Scripts/blob/master/Desktop%20Search%20Script).

To edit the search terms find any of the lines that say: 

`URL GOTO= http://www.bing.com/search?FORM=U312DF&PC=U312&q=Whatever+you+want+your+search+term+to+be`

To change the word or words at the end. For spaces you will have to put a `+`

To edit the amount of time between searches find 

`WAIT SECONDS= 4` 

and replace the number with what you want
